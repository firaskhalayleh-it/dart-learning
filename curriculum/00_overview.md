# Learning Path Overview

## Welcome to Your Dart Journey!

This curriculum is designed to take you from Dart beginner to Flutter-ready developer through hands-on practice with a realistic domain: building a Task & Ticket Tracker service.

## Learning Philosophy

### 1. Progressive Complexity
Each module builds on the previous one, introducing new concepts while reinforcing what you've already learned. We start with basic syntax and gradually move to advanced topics like async programming and architecture patterns.

### 2. Practical Application
Instead of isolated examples, you'll work with a consistent domain throughout the course. This helps you see how different Dart features work together in real applications.

### 3. Test-Driven Learning
From Module 11 onward, you'll learn to write tests first, then implement functionality. This builds confidence and teaches you to think about code design upfront.

### 4. Modern Dart Practices
All examples use Dart 3+ features including null safety, pattern matching, sealed classes, and modern async patterns.

## The Task & Ticket Tracker Domain

Throughout this course, you'll build components of a task and ticket tracking system:

- **Tasks**: Basic todo items with descriptions, due dates, and completion status
- **Tickets**: More complex work items with priorities, assignments, and lifecycle tracking
- **Users**: People who create and work on tasks and tickets
- **Projects**: Collections of related tasks and tickets
- **Services**: Business logic for managing the domain

This domain is rich enough to demonstrate real-world programming concepts while remaining understandable and relatable.

## How Each Module Works

### Structure
Each module follows a consistent pattern:

1. **README.md** - Learning objectives, concepts, and step-by-step instructions
2. **examples/** - Demonstration code showing concepts in action
3. **exercises/** - Practice problems for you to solve
4. **solutions/** - Reference implementations (where provided)

### Learning Process
For each module, follow this process:

1. **Read** the module README to understand the objectives
2. **Study** the examples to see concepts demonstrated
3. **Practice** with the exercises
4. **Reflect** on what you learned and how it connects to previous modules
5. **Test** your understanding by running code and tests

### Time Investment
- **Beginner**: 2-3 hours per module
- **Experienced**: 1-2 hours per module
- **Advanced**: 30-60 minutes per module

Don't rush! It's better to understand concepts deeply than to move quickly through the material.

## Prerequisites

### Programming Experience
This course assumes you have some programming experience in any language. You should be comfortable with:
- Basic programming concepts (variables, functions, loops, conditionals)
- Object-oriented programming basics (classes, objects, methods)
- Command line/terminal usage

### No Dart Experience Required
We start from the beginning with Dart syntax and concepts. Previous experience with similar languages (Java, C#, TypeScript, Kotlin) will help but isn't required.

### Environment Setup
Before starting Module 1, ensure you have:
- Dart SDK 3.2.0 or later installed
- A code editor (VS Code with Dart extension recommended)
- Git for version control
- Terminal/command prompt access

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this curriculum, you will:

### Technical Skills
- **Write idiomatic Dart code** using modern language features
- **Handle async programming** with Futures and Streams confidently
- **Design clean architecture** using proper separation of concerns
- **Test your code effectively** with unit tests and mocking
- **Work with JSON data** and serialization patterns
- **Understand Flutter concepts** and be ready to start building UIs

### Problem-Solving Skills
- **Break down complex problems** into manageable pieces
- **Think about error handling** and edge cases
- **Design APIs** that are easy to use and maintain
- **Refactor code** to improve design and readability

### Best Practices
- **Write self-documenting code** with clear names and structure
- **Use null safety effectively** to prevent runtime errors
- **Apply SOLID principles** in your designs
- **Version control** your work effectively

## Getting Help

### When You're Stuck
1. **Re-read the module README** - often the answer is there
2. **Look at the examples** - they demonstrate the concepts you need
3. **Check the solution** - if provided, see how it's implemented
4. **Search the Dart documentation** - [dart.dev](https://dart.dev) is excellent
5. **Ask questions** - use the repository issues for course-related questions

Remember: learning to program is like learning a musical instrument - it takes practice and patience. Don't get discouraged if concepts don't click immediately. Keep practicing, and everything will come together!
