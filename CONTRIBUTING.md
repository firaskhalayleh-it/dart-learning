## Contribution Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Learner-First**: Always consider the learner's perspective
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Build concepts incrementally
3. **Practical Application**: Use realistic examples and exercises
4. **Modern Dart**: Use current Dart features and best practices
5. **Clear Documentation**: Explain concepts thoroughly

### Content Standards

- **Accuracy**: All code must compile and run correctly
- **Clarity**: Explanations should be clear and jargon-free
- **Completeness**: Cover concepts thoroughly with examples
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and terminology

## Module Creation Guidelines

When creating new modules, follow this structure:

```
modules/XX_module_name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Learning objectives and explanations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/           # Demonstration code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ basic_example.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ advanced_example.dart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exercises/          # Practice problems
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exercise_1.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ exercise_2.dart
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ solutions/          # Reference implementations
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exercise_1_solution.dart
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ exercise_2_solution.dart
```

### README.md Structure

Each module README should include:

1. **Learning Objectives** - What learners will achieve
2. **Key Concepts** - Core concepts with code examples
3. **Examples** - Reference to example files
4. **Exercises** - Practice problems description
5. **Testing Your Understanding** - Self-assessment checklist
6. **Next Steps** - Link to the next module
7. **Additional Resources** - External references

### Example Guidelines

- Include comprehensive comments
- Demonstrate one concept per example
- Use the Task & Ticket domain where possible
- Show both basic and advanced usage
- Include error handling where appropriate

### Exercise Guidelines

- Start with clear instructions
- Provide template code with TODO comments
- Include expected output examples
- Progress from simple to complex
- Relate to real-world scenarios

## Testing Guidelines

### Code Testing

All code examples and solutions must:

1. **Compile without warnings**
   ```bash
   dart analyze
   ```

2. **Pass all tests**
   ```bash
   dart test
   ```

3. **Follow linting rules**
   - Use the provided `analysis_options.yaml`
   - Fix all linter warnings

### Content Testing

Before submitting:

1. **Manual walkthrough** - Follow the module as a learner would
2. **Code execution** - Run all examples and verify output
3. **Exercise validation** - Ensure exercises can be completed
4. **Link checking** - Verify all links work

## Style Guide

### Dart Code Style

- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include comprehensive documentation comments
- Prefer explicit types for public APIs
- Use trailing commas for better diffs

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Write in second person ("you will learn")
- Use active voice
- Include code examples for all concepts
- Use consistent terminology throughout

### File Naming

- Use snake_case for file names
- Use descriptive names that indicate content
- Number exercises sequentially
- Include the module number in file paths
